# EC702
Numerical analysis code and notes for EC 702

These codes solve the stochastic growth model with value function iteration and by iterating on the Euler equation.  [You can find a tutorial explanation of these codes here.](http://people.bu.edu/amckay/EC702/) To download the codes, click "Clone or download" above.
